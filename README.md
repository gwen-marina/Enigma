Enigma - Evaluation Rubric

Functionality = 3
Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented. Both encrypt and decrypt methods and CLI are successfully implemented.

OOP = 4
Project is broken up into 3 classes and I also have one module. I used my module to check for correct user input in my encrypt runner file. No class is longer than 100 lines nor is any too short.

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics = 3.75 (maybe really should be a 4)
Code is properly indented and syntax is consistent. No methods are longer than 10 lines after I refactored my longest methods. I used a hash for my rotated alphabet and a new method, the zip method, that I also shared with some of my fellow cohort mates because it's a pretty neat method. I'm tempted to give myself a 4 on this(and think this should be a 4), but I did use each and that seems to be a no-no at Turing at times, but this is really a 4. :)

TDD = 3
All methods are tested at the unit and integration level. All edge cases are addressed, at least the ones I thought of or noticed while coding. I am sure there are always more edge cases the more you look at code but it's time to lay enigma to rest. Set up all tests before methods were created. SimpleCov is at 100% and RSpec is all green.

Version Control = 4
I had over 53 commits and 7 pull requests with this final merge after cleaning up my code and doing the read me. I think I have vastly improved this inning over the last when it comes to Git workflow. It's like day and night with my Git between Mod 1 and Mod 1.2
